## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Author: JPLACLAU ( https://github.com/JPLACLAU )

This is the course proyect for the coursera course of the John Hopkins University " Getting and Cleaning Data ", it's the third one on the " Data science " specialization. The objective was to take a specific set of rawdata provided by the course and make a tidy dataset.

### What you find in this repository

**ORIGINAL_INSTUCTIONS.TXT**: The original instructions for this proyect.

**CodeBook.md**: information about the variables on the tidy data set and some about the raw data elaboration.

**README.md**: this file

**run_analysis.R**: R script to transform raw data set in a tidy one

**subjects_averages_data.txt**: The tidy dataset is named " *subjects_averages_data.txt* " and should be available for download from the coursera peer-correction system. However, there is a copy-paste of the content of that file on this file.

### Steps to reproduce this proyect (*)
1. Open R-Studio and set your prefered working directory for this proyect.
2. Open the script of this repository " run_analysis.R " on your R-Studio. (https://github.com/JPLACLAU/GettingandCleaningDataCourseProject/blob/master/run_analysis.R )
3. Read the script before you execute it to make sure you agree with the actions on the script.
4. Run the Script. 
5. Enjoy the tidy data set and be very happy about it. 

(The tidy dataset should be on your working directory with the name of " * *subjects_averages_data.txt* * " .)

#### (*) Important
You need the software 7-zip installed on your computer and on default instalation directory in order to unzip the raw dataset provided directly from the R script. Other wise you have to download and unzip the dataset manually inside the working directoy, make sure the default directory subfolder of the raw data is inside the working directory (" ~\UCI HAR Dataset\ ") with all the raw data on it, and then run the scrip ignoring from line 39 to 69. The url of the raw dataset is on the ORIGINAL_INSTUCTIONS.txt file on this repository.
